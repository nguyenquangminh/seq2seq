Question two: Does English have the largest vocabulary?", "answer": "Yes, with approximately 500,000 words and 300,000 technical terms."}, {"question": "Yes, spot on! This is due to the openness of the English language. English has borrowed words from many other languages.", "answer": "Yeah, if there weren\u2019t so many words, it would be easier for us to master it!"}, {"question": "Ha ha\u2026 But the simplicity of form makes English easy to learn. Many English words have been simplified over the centuries. Now, question three: Who can tell me an English word that can operate as a noun, a verb, and an adjective?", "answer": "I think the word <i>subject</i> can operate as a noun, a verb and an adjective."}, {"question": "Excellent. In English, the same word can operate as many parts of speech. That\u2019s due to its flexibility. Question four: What is the longest word in English which has only one vowel?", "answer": "Is it <i>length</i>?"}, {"question": "No, I think it\u2019s <i>strengths</i>.", "answer": "That\u2019s right, Vy.
